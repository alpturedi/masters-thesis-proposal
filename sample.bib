  abstract = {We present a framework for alternative reality (XR) technologies to enable an understanding of what constitutes an XR environment when used in the context of design and engineering of large, complex systems.The framework provides guidelines for implementing the corresponding desired human sensory experience. This work is founded on the existing literature which defines theoretical Spectra, such as Fidelity, to systematically characterize an XR environment taxonomy. We identify landmarks for four XR categories within these Spectra and provide definitions that can used to establish a common vernacular. We further map these to specific human sensing modalities that are influenced by XR, such as tactility and vision, and define the technical requirements needed to augment the human experience in the desired XR environment. Finally, we connect the theoretical elements to the technical requirements to create an integrated XR framework.The utility of this framework is demonstrated in a case study addressing the use of XR technologies for five stakeholder groups involved in the evaluation of spacecraft habitat design and operations. This demonstrates the utility of the proposed XR taxonomy in a spacecraft habitat design process, which could be extended to other similar applications.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to outline a framework for designing performance dashboards, a type of information system used for performance measurement in organizations. Initial briefing in a case company indicated that a framework is needed due to the complexity and spread of the issues related to designing such systems. However, existing literature does not offer a proper tool for this purpose. Instead, earlier literature concentrates either on measurement design or information systems design and does not illustrate the interplay between them very thoroughly. Hence, drawing from a synthesis between performance measurement and information systems literature, a framework for dashboard design was constructed and then refined with the case company in an iterative manner. Action design research method was used to produce a set of principles for design and development of the system. Furthermore, by depicting links between the suggested design principles, the final framework for dashboard design is presented. Practical relevance of the suggested design framework is illustrated in the case context.},

  abstract = {The democratisation of technologies, knowledge and activities have been changing the world of designers, blurring the boundaries between amateur and professional designers, especially within the connected phenomena of the Maker Movement and Indie Designers. Within this context, how can be collaborative design processes documented, analysed, managed, shared? This article investigates the role of meta-design digital tools for the facilitation of distributed systems of creative agents, formally trained and informal amateurs that collaboratively design and produce artefacts. It documents a research study organised for testing a digital meta-design platform with users and the researcher as meta-designer: the results provide insights for improving the platform but also for building a comprehensive research through design framework that connects meta-design research and practice for exploring the role and nature of meta-design and meta-designers in facilitating collaborative design processes starting from their description with digital ontologies.},

  abstract = {The use of the senses of vision and audition as interactive means has dominated the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for decades, even though nature has provided us with many more senses for perceiving and interacting with the world around us. That said, it has become attractive for HCI researchers and designers to harness touch, taste, and smell in interactive tasks and experience design. In this paper, we present research and design insights gained throughout an interdisciplinary collaboration on a six-week multisensory display \textendash{} Tate Sensorium \textendash{} exhibited at the Tate Britain art gallery in London, UK. This is a unique and first time case study on how to design art experiences whilst considering all the senses (i.e., vision, sound, touch, smell, and taste), in particular touch, which we exploited by capitalizing on a novel haptic technology, namely, mid-air haptics. We first describe the overall set up of Tate Sensorium and then move on to describing in detail the design process of the mid-air haptic feedback and its integration with sound for the Full Stop painting by John Latham (1961). This was the first time that mid-air haptic technology was used in a museum context over a prolonged period of time and integrated with sound to enhance the experience of visual art. As part of an interdisciplinary team of curators, sensory designers, sound artists, we selected a total of three variations of the mid-air haptic experience (i.e., haptic patterns), which were alternated at dedicated times throughout the six-week exhibition. We collected questionnaire-based feedback from 2500 visitors and conducted 50 interviews to gain quantitative and qualitative insights on visitors' experiences and emotional reactions. Whilst the questionnaire results are generally very positive with only a small variation of the visitors' arousal ratings across the three tactile experiences designed for the Full Stop painting, the interview data shed light on the differences in the visitors' subjective experiences. Our findings suggest multisensory designers and art curators can ensure a balance between surprising experiences versus the possibility of free exploration for visitors. In addition, participants expressed that experiencing art with the combination of mid-air haptic and sound was immersive and provided an up-lifting experience of touching without touch. We are convinced that the insights gained from this large-scale and real-world field exploration of multisensory experience design exploiting a new and emerging technology provide a solid starting point for the HCI community, creative industries, and art curators to think beyond conventional art experiences. Specifically, our work demonstrates how novel mid-air technology can make art more emotionally engaging and stimulating, especially abstract art that is often open to interpretation.},
